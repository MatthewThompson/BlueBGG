# BlueBGG
Discord bot for interacting with the BoardGameGeek API, making use of [arnak](https://github.com/MatthewThompson/arnak/) to access the API.

Currently a work in progress, with just some dummy features to test it works end to end.
Some planned features:
 - Search owned games under specific criteria such as min/max rating, player count, min/max time, genre.
 - Store a mapping of discord to bgg username so you can @people and get games that a group owns.
 - Information on specific games with links to BGG.
